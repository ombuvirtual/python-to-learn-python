# Python to learn Python

This project is in its inception stage so it's not ready for general
use.

When it's finished _Python To Learn Python_ will be a small collection
of amply documented Python scripts and associated _github pages_
designed as an introduction to some of the main features of the Python
language. It's the way I'm learning Python. I've made the repository
public in the off chance that it might be useful to someone else.

When I finish the first draft I will add an appropriate license to it.
