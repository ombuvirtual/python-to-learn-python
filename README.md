# Python to learn Python

This project is in its inception stage so it's not ready for general
use.

When it's finished _Python To Learn Python_ will be a collection of
amply documented Python scripts designed as an introduction to the
Python language. I think of it as an _executable book_, i.e. a book
with executable pages (scripts). It's the way I'm learning
Python. I've made the repository public in the off chance that it
might be useful to someone else.

When I finish the first draft I will add an appropriate license to it.

Visit the [associated github pages][ghp] generated from the
documentation within the Python scripts.
